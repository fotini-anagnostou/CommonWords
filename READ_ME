1. 	It keeps the lines of the first file and the common lines in memory. it also keeps the sorted lines in memory. 
	So it depends on the memory of the server.
2. 	I would remove the lines from inputFileALinesand outputFileLines as soon as I don't need them anymore.
	I would insert the new value in the list in the correct index so that it will be sorted.
3. 	It reads the first file and then the second file and then it writes the output, so it is not as efficient as it can get.
4. 	I would read the input files in parallel.
